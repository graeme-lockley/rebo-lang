# rebo-lang

Rebo is a strongly typed interpreted programming language. It is a work in progress.

I love tinkering around with programming languages trying to understand the techniques used to implement them.  I have been working on a number of projects in [little languages](https://github.com/littlelanguages) exploring techniques leading up to this one.

Primary influences:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) using [Deno](https://deno.com)
- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)

Rebo itself has the following features:

- Indent based syntax,
- Strongly typed,
- Local and remote packages,
- Record types,
- Abstract data types with methods,
- Value type signatures,
- Type aliases,
- Exceptions,
- IO Operation side effects, and
- Standard prelude

All these features are implemented in Kotlin.

It is super early so, for now, star the project or periodically check back for updates.

- Where does the name "Rebo" come from?  I am an annoying Star Wars fan and it is a reference to the [Max Rebo Band](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Max_Rebo_Band) from Return of the Jedi.

## Languages of interest

This list is of languages that I am keeping an eye on - they are interesting and I am curious to see how they evolve.

- [Gleam](https://gleam.run) is very similar to Rebo.  It is a strongly typed functional language that compiles to Erlang.  I think if Gleam had Deno's remote package support it would be a very good fit for me.
- [Oak](https://oaklang.org) is an interpreted language written in Go.
