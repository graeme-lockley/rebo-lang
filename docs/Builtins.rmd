Rebo is released with a number of builtin functions. These functions are always available and are attached to the top-level scope.

## cwd()

Returns the current working directory as a string.

```rebo
cwd()
```

## exit(code = 0)

Immediately exits the program with the given exit code.

```rebo
exit()
```

Should `code` be anything other than an integer, it will be converted to a string, printed to stderr and exit with exit code 1.

```rebo
exit("Invalid number of arguments")
```

## gc()
